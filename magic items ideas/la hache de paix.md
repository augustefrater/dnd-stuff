you have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
all hits agains objects are critical

this axe has multiple states that you unlock by performing a feat using this axe.
you keep the benefices from weaker states in more powerfull ones

base: while attuned to the axe you have a +5 bonus to checks and saving throws to avoid being moved.
you can use an action to magically wedge the axe in a surface or large object and causie it to be stuck in it. until it's no longer attuned to you or you pick it up the axe is stuck to the object or surface even if it defies gravity the axe can hold up to 8000 pounds of weight. more weight causes the effect to deactivate and the axe to fall. a creature can make a 30 strenght check, ending the effect.

awakened: while attuned to the axe you can manipulate its weight.you can use an attack, a bonus action,  2d8 slashing damage on your next attack and a 5% greater critical chance any number of times. the more power concentrates in the weapon, the more runes appear and the darker the head of the axe becomes, to the point where patters on the blade arent visible.

exalted: while attuned to the axe you can hit the ground instead of an object or creature and cause all creatures excluding you in a radius of 15ft take the damage your attack would have inflicted. one used this ability needs to rcharge. to recharge the ability you can throw a d6 at the top of your turn. on a 5 or 6 you regain the ability. while the ability is available, the head of the axe creates shadow instead of reflecting light, anything against the head of the axe seem to be obscured as if in shadows.
