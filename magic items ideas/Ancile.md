dormant: while attuned to the shield, you gain one legendary resistance per day.

awakened: while attuned to the shield, you can cast antimagic field without expanding a spellslot once per day. a gem at the center of the shield lights after the spell has ben cast. while it's being cast all magical energy gets absorbed into the gem, making it glow more and more.

exalted: the sield has 9 emplacements to store magic represented by 9 rubys. when you are targeted with a spell and suceed on the save or the spell attack dosent hit your ac, you can with a reaction store the spell's energy in the sield and the spell has no effect. a spell takes a number of slots equal to the level of the spell and that same number of rubys lignt up .if you dont have the space to store the spell inside of the shield, the spell is stored but you take 2d8 dammage per level over the limit at the start of your turn while red lighning surges from the shield trying to let out the spell energy.
you can use an action to cas a spell stored in the shield a number of rubys equal to the spell level turning off.the spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell.
If the spell is of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the sheild with no other effect.
