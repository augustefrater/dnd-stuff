You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

this technically a heavy crossbow has multiple states that you unlock by performing a feat using it.
you keep the benefices from weaker states in more powerfull ones

dormant:you can once per turn shoot a magically enhanced round that goes trough the target and hits the next hittable thing in line. the attack role is the same but the bonus is reduced by ( damage - amount over the armor class) with a minimum of zero
if you hit a creature with an armor class of 15 with a 16 for 5 damage, the next attack is a 12 (15 - (5 - (16 - 15))).
if the shot cant beat the armor class of a creature or gets out of the long range of the weapon, it stops.

awaken: as you are about to fire, golden particles tracing the trajectory of the bullet, including bounces. when shooting an enhanced bullet, you can take a mallus of 5 to your attack roll to decide in what directon the bullet will go after going through the target. you can take this mallus any number of time to make mutiple ricochets between enemies. you have to call the shot before rolling to attack.
example: you hit creatures with an armor class of 12 with a 25 for 5 damage each, and want to make two ricochet.
the first attack is a 15, the second is a 13 and the third is a 8, not hitting.

exhalted:the bullets now noticably blow more and more with golden light when going trough a creature or object. when stopping that energy is released as a golden firework. when the enhanced bullet stops, it explodes, causing all creatures in a 10ft area to take thunder damage equal (attack roll - armor class) of all hits if they do not succeed a dexterity saving throw agains 8 + prof + dex.
