this trident has multiple states that you unlock by performing a feat using this axe.

dormant: while attuned to the trident, you have a swim speed equal to two times your walking speed, you can breathe water, you gain the ability to jump 40ft out of water and landing without damage if the fall is less than 60fy.

awakened: the trident grows harpoon-like points made out of flowing water while the trident is planted in an object or creature, the harpoon like points expand and make it hard and damaging to pull out. you can instead of a two handed attack gore the target, planting the trident firmly on the target. you can pull out the trident with a bonus action, doing 1d6 slashing damage and causing bleeding. while the trident is planted in a creature, you know its location, have advantage on attacks agains it. any creature may make a strenght check of 20 to rip out the trident, causing 2d8 slashing damage and bleeding.

exhalted: while attuned to the trident, the golden rope extends to coil arround your arm, preventing you from being disarmed.
when you throw or drop the trident, the rope grows to allow the trident to go away from you.
you can use your movement to call back the trident, making the rope shrinks to its original size at a speed of 120ft/s. 
if the trident is free to move it will come back to you, if it's stuck, you are pulled to it, if it's stuck in a creature you make opposed strenght checks to determine who is pulled by who. both you and the creature may fail on purpose. if the results have 5 or less of difference, you both are pulled to the center.
