you have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

this pickaxe has multiple states that you unlock by performing a feat using this axe.
you keep the benefices from weaker states in more powerfull ones

dormant: while attuned to the pick, when you attack a creature with the pick and attack a different creature on the same turn with another attack, the d4s of peircing damage becomes d6s

awakened: while attuned to the pick, when you hit an enemy with a mele attack, a d4 of peircing damage is added to the dammage of the weapon. this bonus resets when you take damage. the pick seems to target weakoints of your enemy easyer and easyer and seem to bounce back without loosing force after hitting a hard surface, priming you for the next strike.

exhalted: while attuned to the pick, you can use a legendary action a number of time equal to your constitution modifyer per day.
the pickaxe seem to blur easyly even at low speed
