wants: to have the validation of a crowd as an artist to prove his value and his village wrong
needs: to see that the validation or distain of other people does not define his value, he has it because of himself, not as the will of others.

so how does his deal looks
he want to be recognized as an artist so how about levistus lies to him and says his artist powers come from him, but in actuality he just knows how power in general works better than leopold. he does not have any control over leopold's power.

how does he appear?
i think taking control of the art leopold makes is the way to go. like while painting a portrait taht takes some time the portrait comes to life and teaches him how this works. or at some point if they do a self portrait it's even better. maybe waking in the middle of the night having painted a self portrait.
maybe his friend?
no
maybe if they're alone and use the transparent paint in a peice, they see 2-3m from them they see themself? someone else? i think a rotoscopied-style animated painting of themself? watching. the figure (levistus) know damn well they're an illusion but acts like they're a manifestation of leopold's subconcient trough art and acts like they do not know leopold can see them. they keep observing. they wont talk tho they can, but will paint and write what they want. once they notice that leopold can see them they will draw a series of painting wich will be displayed on the ground in order after they are finished. telling a story. the scene from the prison where he discovered his art had magic potential, with themself watching over. implied they gave them the power.
then they paint leopold using the power to help people and the people being happy, then the people talling stories about him, and finally people in a city recognizing him and thanking him.
but then a picture of a shadowed monster that uses perspective to imply that leopold will never be strong enough. it is placed not in a line but a bit lower than it sould be. then one of leopold's grave, maked with only his date of birth and a wrong spelling of his name and it's been damaged by the elements, implying nobody's taking care of it.
now placed just above the foe is leopold and themself shaking hands.
then it's leopold kicking the foe's ass with magic.
then it's leopold using trickery on a demon that is standing guard over them.
then it's both of them bowing to an extatic audience.

this implies he needs to ally with them for fame in exchange for their freedom.

the power he gets is reminicent of the first time he used magic, but way less powerfull. he can use a magic ability he has already seen if he spends an amount of time and recources appropriate trough them. for instance he might replicate a magic missile spell (or scroll) by spending a minute painting. they are a peice of art and can be worked on in multiple sessins as opposed to spells typically being cast without interruptions allowed. any magic already replicated will be easyer and faster to do.
the scale for leveled spells are: 30s, 1min, 5min, 20min, 1h30, 4h, 8h, 16h, 2j, 7j.

if it does not exist but would be possible, it's multiplied by 1000.
if you've never seen it but know the effect has been done it's multiplied by 100.
if you've seen it done it's multiplied by 10.
if you've seen it done multiple time it's multiplied by 1.
if you've done it once before it's multiplied by 4/5.
if you've done it multiple times it's multiplied by 2/3.

you can have a number of people helping roughly equivalent to the level of what the spell would be.
helf from an artist will multiply the timbe by 2/3 for each artist.
help from a non artist will multiply the time by 4/5.

the effect typically takes place the moment it's completed but you can take longet to make it usable by someone else.
it's multiplied by 1.5

you can fail to do the art peice, the chance of success is equal to level / (11 + spell level)

what does he want in exchange? to eventually take the group to hell to staiga in order to free him, his powers helping to
