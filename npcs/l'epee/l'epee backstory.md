l'epee est l'avatar present du syndicat, un groupe de mortels qui ont ete des warlocs de leur viant au premier membre du syndicat apres sa mort et qui apres leur mort l'ont rejoint pour assister leur successeur.

the first one was a mage/warlock of eblis of the unbended knee that eventually betrayed him when their goals no longer aligned.
the first one was a benevolent being hell bent on destroying unnecessary and unjust hierarchies.
they were reveared and aclaimed by thoes they liberated but eventually died.
no god wanted to allow them in his kingdon, less their power mey be taken from them.
the first one had to create their own kingdon.
the powers given to them by thoes they saved didnt allow them much, but enough to spot their eventual heir.

then the second one, known for his way with words blazed their path and fought for many peoples across the planes but met as their predecessor an unfortunate end.
they then rejoined the first one, both of them choosing the next person to continue the work of their lifetime.

the third one used a pickaxe from their workplace, the fourth a trident, the fifth a shield, the sixth an axe, the seventh a gun and the current one, the eight uses a blade.

all of them had access to the weapons of the ones before them and a part of their masrtery of it.
the people saved by them know of the story, sometime fading in the local folklore, sometimes earning a place in a book, but always fading when it is unpleasen to the next tyrant.
kings, masters, dictators, even some devils began to know of them and fear their influence. be it by words, magic, or a good ol impalement, they threaten the stability of unjust rulers, leading them to try and bribe them or get rid of them.
some benevolent rulers try to help them get rid of the plague taht are dictatorships but the alliance only ever was an alignment of goals.
