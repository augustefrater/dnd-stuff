- a rolnorian gang of gunslinger and ranger cowboys and warlocks and artificer archetypes on magic bikes
- more items that you can use spellslots on
- that one religious city you know the one, probably will be one in the republic probably bahamut high priest is an albino dragonborn
- items that unlock things after conditions are met
- an hommage character to technoblade. i'm thinking a like of warlocks. the first one was a mage/warlock of eblis of the unbended knee that eventually betrayed him when their goals no longer aligned. the first one was a benevolent being hell bent on destroying unnecessary and unjust hierarchies. they were reveared and aclaimed by thoes they liberated but eventually died. no god wanted to allow them in his kingdon, less their power mey be taken from them. the first one had to create their own kingdon. the powers given to them by thoes they saved didnt allow them much, but enough to spot their eventual heir. then the second one, known for his way with words blazed their path and fought for many peoples across the planes but met as their predecessor an unfortunate end. they then rejoined the first one, both of them choosing the next person to continue the work of their lifetime. the third one used a pickaxe from their workplace, the fourth a trident, the fifth a shield, the sixth an axe, the seventh a gun and the current one is known as the blade. all of them had access to the weapons of the ones before them and a part of their martery of it. the people saved by them know of the story, sometime fading in the local folklore, sometimes earning a place in a book, fot always fading when it is unpleasen to the next tyrant. kings, masters, dictators, even some devils began to know of them and fear their influence. be it by words, magic, or a good ol impalement, they threaten the stability of unjust rulers, leading them to try and bribe them or get rid of them. some benevolent rulers try to help them get rid of the plague taht are dictatorships but the alliance only ever was an alignment of goals.
- need to develop eblis then
- avatar of bahamut in the church of bahamut is a fake, it's a cooper dragon that's been platinum plated at birth and then every time they shed their skin. their breath weapon isnt consistent with what the platinum dragon has and using it in public would reveal them.
a real avatar of bahamut exists but was born with albinism, their breath weapon manifesting first as frost and their familly being silver, the albino dragon was just a bit off colour and nobody thought anything of it.
need to find a module to fit that cool idea. peobably politics and control of the church


!! do for the oneshot !!

arthur get the fuck out

i will eat your metal dice if i catch you, i will eat them with my mouth. i may die tasting revenge but the sweet taste of it will rival ambrosia

the emperor died without an heir, he has left a will that contains the name of the inheritor of the throne, but if the name of someone alive isnt found, the noble will have to elect the next leader of the empire

the church of Oghma, elven god of knowlege has vast knowlege available for the masses, and almost as much dirt, plans, contingences and agents wating to be used to get the chuch into a better position to get power, for what is the use of knowlege if left to rot?
a team of 4 mostly expandable agents has been sent to skew the results of the power passasion in order to make their own puppet hold the strings of the empire.
gars a faire elir c'est lord herbert de gnommia

that same church has hidden away the true heir to the throne, a young half elven half orc lady that is sceptical about the church and the usefullness of all that regency bullshit. the church wants to prevent her from acessing the throne, as most people knowing her blood's significance do, because she isnt a reliable agent.
doit ne pas se faire reperer
sait que y'a une team qui cherche a mettre un memebre de l'eglise au pouvoir et qu'elle est la backup

a sincere but delusional bard, thinking themself a hero of the people but who's an involontary conman stumbled into the party, frustrated that they did not get an invite to that once in a lifetime event, worthy of their attention. it's unclear if they saw the lights on and decided to enter or if they were influenced by a changeling in disguise
would enjoy a good duel, i'll have to make one

going from twn to town and adopting a new face at each stop, a changling that dosent remember his original form needs to find an who he is. each village is the same. a handsome stranger walks in, makes friends and an honest ilfe for himself, begins to become popular, and at the first mischeif or slip, you get torches and pitchforks pointed at you, running to then next town the road leads you too. at the anouncement of the death of the imperator, a question pops in the head of the nomad shapeshifter : what best to become than the ruler to find yourself?
falsified the titles of Herbert of gnomia
is the object of a quest for revange from William sebille

in the midst of nobles and heroes trying to seize the title is a humble artificer that wants to use his place into the castle to alter the course of the night in order to put a benevolent emperor at the helm of his land
wants to make it so amadeus takes the head of the country.

an orc warrior, searching for worthy opponents is provided them by a deal with a fey, they have to protect a guy and kill another this fatefull night
guy to defend is Elrond Minnil, un noble elf exentrique qui est connu pour ses inventions
guy to kill is samson rigard, an assasin sent to kill Elrond disguised as a noble. the orc does not know he is an assasin.

events to have:
-murder mistery (william sebille killed a guy and tries to frame elrond Minnil for it)
-it's madeus coming back (he dosent know that he's already suppoed to have arrived, people will talk about it and it will reach willam)
    to do in the middle of the murder mystery
-a guy gets found trying to steal the will using the vent
    just a chase scene if initiative failed and a chase the other way/fight if succeded he's a samson
