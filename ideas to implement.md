- a rolnorian gang of gunslinger and ranger cowboys and warlocks and artificer archetypes on magic bikes
- more items that you can use spellslots on
- that one religious city you know the one, probably will be one in the republic probably bahamut high priest is an albino dragonborn
- items that unlock things after conditions are met

- need to develop eblis then
- avatar of bahamut in the church of bahamut is a fake, it's a cooper dragon that's been platinum plated at birth and then every time they shed their skin. their breath weapon isnt consistent with what the platinum dragon has and using it in public would reveal them.
a real avatar of bahamut exists but was born with albinism, their breath weapon manifesting first as frost and their familly being silver, the albino dragon was just a bit off colour and nobody thought anything of it.
need to find a module to fit that cool idea. peobably politics and control of the church
